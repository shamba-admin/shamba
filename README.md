# Small-Holder Agriculture Mitigation Benefit Assessment (SHAMBA) project. version 2.0

The [SHAMBA README](shamba/README.md) has detailed instructions on how to install and use the SHAMBA tool.

The model_documentation folder contains the detailed scientific description of the model, as well documentation on how to implement the Plan Vivo Approved Approach for using SHAMBA.

View the `shamba_command_line.py` file in a Python IDE for details on how to run SHAMBA with the data-input-templates. The script is already set up to run with the example with the è `example_SHAMBA_input_output_uganda_tech_spec.xlsx` file.
