# Small-Holder Agriculture Mitigation Benefit Assessment (SHAMBA) model, version 1.2

The [SHAMBA README](shamba/README.md) has detailed instructions on how to install and use the SHAMBA tool.

The docs folder contains the detailed scientific description of the model and a user guide. For documentation on how to implement the Plan Vivo approved methodology, see the Plan Vivo website at: https://www.planvivo.org/pt001 

View the `shamba_command_line.py` file in a Python IDE for details on how to run SHAMBA with the data-input-templates. The script is already set up to run with the example with the `example_SHAMBA_input_output_uganda_tech_spec.xlsx` file.
